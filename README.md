## Description

I want to create a small AngularJS 1.x application with a couple of unit tests to prepare for a job interviews.
In particular, it sounds like LateRooms have a tech test involving AngularJS. I don't have any further information.

## Outline

Not sure. Maybe something involving GitHub repos and their REST API.

* Use the simplest possible web server to serve the static SPA files([http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server))
* Show a list of repos with summary information of each.
* Click a repo to see more details about the repo
* Unit tests ?
* End-to-end tests ?

## Future Plans

* Do another tech test but use angular-seed as a starting point
* Do another tech test but use Gulp to do babel, etc. 
* Do another tech test but use webpack to do babel, etc.
