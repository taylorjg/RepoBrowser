This repo is a little AngularJS 1.x application with a couple of unit tests to prepare for a job interviews.

## Outline

Something fairly simple involving the GitHub API.

* Show a list of repos with summary information of each.
* Click a repo to see more details about the repo
* Unit tests ?
* End-to-end tests ?

## Future Plans

* Do another tech test but use angular-seed as a starting point
* Do another tech test but use Gulp to do babel, etc. 
* Do another tech test but use webpack to do babel, etc.
